          Q: What's on the <b>Dashboard</b>?
        </p>
        <p class="help-faq-answer">
          A: The <b>Dashboard</b> is where all your sticky notes are!
          Treat this like it's your school agenda, so you'll know when your next exam is! It's that easy!

        </p>
        <p class="help-faq-answer">
          A: <b>Flashcards</b> are, well, flashcards! Put your questions on the left column and the answers on the right column!
          Now, activate your brain in study mode, and study!

          Q: How do I change <b>Settings</b>?
        </p>
        <p class="help-faq-answer">
          A: Here, you only have <b>one</b> setting, and that's to change your profile picture!
          Just go to your <b>Dashboard</b>, select <b>User Settings</b> on the sidebar, and upload an image of your choice!
          Or if you're on the homepage or on mobile, select your name on the top right corner, and select <b>User Settings</b> on the dropdown!

          Q: Why was this project made?
        </p>
        <p class="help-faq-answer">
          A: Christan and his friends wanted to expand on the idea of Quizlet and its related applications.
          They tried to implement it in Ruby and Rails, but they barely made progress.
          A year or so later, Christan revived this idea and decided to use it for his undergraduate research class at Georgia Gwinnett College.
          This app constitutes only 50% of what they had in mindâ€”he didn't want to be too ambitious, especially with only one person, or rather student, working on it.
